##  Wireshark for Beginners: TCP/IP Protocol Fundamentals

### Objective
This project focused on learning network traffic analysis with Wireshark, gaining insight into TCP/IP protocols, and analyzing real-time packet data.

### Skills Learned
- TCP/IP protocol fundamentals.
- Capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.
- Filtering and decoding network traffic.
- Interpreting packets for security and troubleshooting purposes.

### Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Packet capture and network analysis tool.
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Created a testing environment for traffic capture.

### Steps Involved
1. **Setup**: Installed Wireshark and configured it to capture network traffic.
2. **Packet Capture**: Captured live network traffic and observed packets in real time.
3. **Protocol Analysis**: Analyzed TCP, UDP, and other protocols for packet structure.
4. **Traffic Filtering**: Applied Wireshark filters to focus on specific protocols and network events.
5. **Event Monitoring**: Monitored network events such as handshakes, data transfers, and session closures.

### Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in network traffic analysis and deepened my understanding of TCP/IP protocols. Using Wireshark, I gained practical skills for troubleshooting and monitoring network activity, which are essential for cybersecurity roles such as SOC analyst or network security engineer.
